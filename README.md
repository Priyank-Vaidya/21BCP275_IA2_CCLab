Sure, I can format and expand the Dockerfile explanation to make it more organized and clear. Here's the revised version:

```markdown
# Docker File Explanation

The Dockerfile specifies the instructions to build an image for running our application inside a container.

### Base Image Selection

The starting of the Dockerfile specifies the author name and the Dockerfile version.

```Dockerfile
FROM node:18.16.0
FROM python:3.8-slim
```

These are the image distributions along with their versions which will be used for executing our application inside the container.

### Setting Working Directory

```Dockerfile
WORKDIR /backend
```

With this command, we are setting the working directory as the backend, which specifies the reference directory and files from the `/backend` directory level in the container file system.

### Updating System and Installing Dependencies

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y && \
    npm
```

This command updates the system after package installation, as done in the first step.

### First Stage of Installation

```Dockerfile
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
```

Firstly, this copies the server `package.json` dependency file. We aim to first download all the necessary dependencies and then copy the entire codebase to run the application in the container.

```Dockerfile
COPY . .
```

This copies all the files from the home directory to the container directory i.e `/backend`.

### Second Stage of Installation and Configuration

```Dockerfile
WORKDIR /backend/ml_model
COPY ./ml_model/requirements.txt .
```

Setting the working directory in the container file system 1 layer below of `/backend` for `ml_model`. Copying only the requirements first. This command will copy the contents of `ml_model` directory to the container `/backend/ml_model` directory.

```Dockerfile
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Installing all the requirements for running the Python application.

```Dockerfile
COPY ./ml_model ./backend/ml_model
```

Copying all the code in the `ml_model` local directory to the container directory.

```Dockerfile
COPY ./configure-cloudsql-password.sh ../scripts
```

In order to configure the password for Cloud SQL for storing the predictions of `ml_model`, I have written the bash file for performing and configuring the Google Cloud Cloud SQL. This copies the bash file into the `/scripts` directory at the `/backend` level.

### Environment Variables Configuration

```Dockerfile
ENV GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT ${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}
ENV GOOGLE_CLOUD_SQL_USERNAME ${GOOGLE_CLOUD_SQL_USERNAME}
ENV GOOGLE_CLOUD_SQL_PASSWORD ${GOOGLE_CLOUD_SQL_PASSWORD}
ENV GOOGLE_CLOUD_SQL_DATABASE ${GOOGLE_CLOUD_SQL_DATABASE}
ENV GOOGLE_CLOUD_SQL_HOST ${GOOGLE_CLOUD_SQL_HOST}
ENV GOOGLE_CLOUD_SQL_PORT ${GOOGLE_CLOUD_SQL_PORT}
```

As you see, the environment variables specified after `${}` needs to be configured by the automated workflow while initializing the VM on which the application needs to be run. Here VM is an abbreviation of the Linux system on which the containers are executed.

### Running Python Script and Exposing Ports

```Dockerfile
RUN python3 db.py
```

Running the `db.py` file for using the Cloud SQL.

```Dockerfile
EXPOSE 3000
```

Exposing container port 3000 for open traffic to access the application.

```Dockerfile
CMD ["python3", "stock_market_prediction.py"]
```

Start executing the predictions by running the Python scripts.

```Dockerfile
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Finally, start the application by running it in the Node.js environment.

# Docker-compose.yml


The Docker Compose file specifies the configuration for running interdependent containers.

### db 

It uses the Postgres public image from the Docker registry and runs the necessary configuration set up from `configuration-postgres.sh` bash file.

There are some other parameters e.g. data path, volume, bridge.

### app

Uses the Dockerfile as its dependency on executing application. It depends on the db services and is connected to the same network as the db, i.e. bridge.

### psql 

Depends on db service and connected to the same network for execution.
```

This structured explanation provides a clear understanding of the Dockerfile and Docker Compose configuration. Each section is broken down into smaller parts with explanations, making it easier to follow and comprehend.

Here's the explanation of the provided docker-compose.yml, formatted line by line:

```yaml
version: '3'

# Services: 
  # db
  # app
  # psql-command

services:
  # Configuration for the 'db' service
  db:
    image: postgres:latest  # Use the latest version of the Postgres image from Docker Hub
    restart: always  # Restart the container automatically if it exits
    env_file:  # Load environment variables from a file named .env
      - .env
    volumes:  # Mount the local ./data directory to /var/lib/postgresql/data in the container
      - ./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:  # Connect the container to the 'bridge' network
      - bridge

  # Configuration for the 'app' service
  app:
    build:  # Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile in the current directory
      context: .
      dockerfile: dockerfile
    restart: always  # Restart the container automatically if it exits
    ports:  # Map port 3000 on the host to port 3000 on the container
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:  # Wait for the 'db' service to be ready before starting this service
      - db
    env_file:  # Load environment variables from a file named .env
      - .env
    networks:  # Connect the container to the 'bridge' network
      - bridge

  # Configuration for the 'psql-command' service
  psql-command:
    image: postgres:latest  # Use the latest version of the Postgres image from Docker Hub
    restart: always  # Restart the container automatically if it exits
    depends_on:  # Wait for the 'db' service to be ready before starting this service
      - db
    networks:  # Connect the container to the 'bridge' network
      - bridge
      
networks:
  bridge:
    driver: bridge  # Use the 'bridge' network driver
```

Explanation:

- The `version: '3'` specifies the Docker Compose file format version being used.
- Under `services:`, configuration for each service is defined.
- For the `db` service:
  - `image: postgres:latest` specifies to use the latest version of the Postgres image from Docker Hub.
  - `restart: always` ensures that the container restarts automatically if it exits.
  - `env_file:` loads environment variables from a file named `.env`.
  - `volumes:` mounts the local `./data` directory to `/var/lib/postgresql/data` in the container.
  - `networks:` connects the container to the `bridge` network.
- For the `app` service:
  - `build:` specifies to build the Docker image using the Dockerfile in the current directory.
  - `restart: always` ensures that the container restarts automatically if it exits.
  - `ports:` maps port 3000 on the host to port 3000 on the container.
  - `depends_on:` specifies to wait for the `db` service to be ready before starting this service.
  - `env_file:` loads environment variables from a file named `.env`.
  - `networks:` connects the container to the `bridge` network.
- For the `psql-command` service:
  - `image: postgres:latest` specifies to use the latest version of the Postgres image from Docker Hub.
  - `restart: always` ensures that the container restarts automatically if it exits.
  - `depends_on:` specifies to wait for the `db` service to be ready before starting this service.
  - `networks:` connects the container to the `bridge` network.
- Under `networks:`, the `bridge` network is defined with the `bridge` network driver.
